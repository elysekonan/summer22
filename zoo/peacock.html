      The indian peacock has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, but the green peacock has green and bronze body feathers.
      The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers, but higly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen
      when a peacock fans his tail.
