      Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white stripes coats. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories
      have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras are primarily grazers and can
      subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick.
