      Elephants are the largest land mammals on the earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings,
      greet other elephants, or suck up water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to protect the elephant's
      trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to
      find water underground.
